# TheSecretGarden

Code for term project for HCI Course (CSED402,POSTECH).

## Project Description
The Secret Garden is a VR Journal Application targeted for the Oculus Quest.
Users can draw a flower (or basically any object of their choice!) and attach a journal entry to it.

The draw scene lets you choose the color and size of your brush stroke and with it you can draw any object of your choice in 3D, much like the `Tilt Brush` application. 
Go and check out [what my garden looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKpxw6VBhO8)

Here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fhUzWhXV2I) that briefly shows how to use the application.

The final report for this project can be found in the main repository.
